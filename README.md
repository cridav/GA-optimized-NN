# GA-optimized-NN
Optimize a neural network using a genetic algorithm
Data set: https://www.kaggle.com/c/hivprogression

main_NN_GA_2.py employs genetic_algorithm_v1.py and NN_mod3_GA.py to find the classification problem of the proposed data set.

genetic_algorithm_v1.py : Contains the functions belonging to the genetic algorithm

NN_mod3_GA.py : It has already implemented a neural network with backpropagation, some functions are used in order to calculate the forward part, accuracy and dispersion matrix.
